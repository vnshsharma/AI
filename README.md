## ðŸ“Œ How to Use This Structure

- Start from `00_Prerequisites/` to brush up on Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and essential math concepts.
- Move to `01_Machine_Learning/` to explore Supervised and Unsupervised Learning algorithms and complete ML projects.
- Progress to `02_Deep_Learning/` where youâ€™ll dive into neural networks, CNN, RNN, NLP, and other advanced topics.
- Use `03_AI_Utilities/` for scripts and tools that help with AI workflows like data preprocessing and model saving.
- Apply your knowledge by building real-world projects in `04_AI_Applications/`.
- Document theory, notes, and research papers in `05_Research_and_Notes/`.
- Finally, learn to deploy your AI models in production using `06_Deployment_and_Production/`.
