'''
Find groups (clusters) in data such that similar points are in the same group.

EXAMPLE:
        You have a bunch of customers and want to group them based on buying habits â€” clustering will form groups like:

            -> High spenders

            -> Budget buyers

print('Cluster for 2:', model.predict([[2]]))
